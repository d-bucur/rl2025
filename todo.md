- kicking enemy

- nonblocking animations should not block player movement (maybe add tween queue)
- in overhead mode camera shouldn't rotate with side movement
- movement animation is a bit jerky
- animation for invalid movement
- better draw order for transparent objects (some ordering bugs right now). Or just render characters on top
